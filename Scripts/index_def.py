# Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) definition
"""
NDVI is used thoughout crop production and measures 
phtotsynthetically active biomass in plants. 
However, this index is senstive to soil brightness and atmospheric effects -
this can be mitigated though other indices (EVI, SAVI, ARVI, GCL, SIPI)
"""

    logger.info("Creating NDVI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("NDVI",
                        (nir - red)/(nir + red))
 
# Red-Edge Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (RECI)
"""
Index measures chlorophyll content in leaves that are nourished by nitrogen. 
Shows the photosyntheic activity of the canopy cover. 
"""

    logger.info("Creating RECI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("RECI",
                        (nir/red) -1)

# Normalized Difference Red Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE)
"""
Is a joint measure of NDVI and RECI indices. 
This index combines NIR spectral bands and a specific band for 
the narrow range between the visible red and read-nir transition
zone. 
"""

    write_index_to_file("NDRE",
                        nir - rededge) / (nir + rededge)

# Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI)
"""
This index is designated to mitigate soil effects on crop monitoring 
results. It is applied when NDVI can't provide accurate values - particually
with a high percentage of bare soil, scarce vegetation, or low chlorophyll
content in plants
"""

# Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI)
"""
GNDVI is a modification of NDVI but substitutes the green band for the red band.
GNDVI measures chlorophyll content more accurately than NDVI.
"""
def gndvi(nir, green):
    write_index_to_file("GNDVI",((nir - green) / (nir + green)))

# Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
"""
This index outlines open water bodies and assess their turbidity,
mitigating the reflectance of soil and land vegetation cover. 
"""
def ndwi(nir, green):
    logger.info("Creating NDWI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("NDWI",((green - nir) / (green + nir)))

# Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)
"""
Corrects the NDVI index by adding an adjustment factor L to the equation. 
This corrects for soil noise (soil color, moisture, variability etc)
"""
def savi(nir, red, l):
    logger.info("Creating SAVI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("SAVI",(((nir - red) / (nir + red + l)) * (1 + l)))

# Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI)
"""
Modified SAVI index, which uses reflectance in the NIR and red bands. 
The difference between OSAVI and SAVI is that OSAVI takes into account
the standard value of the canopy background adjustment factor (0.16)
"""
def osavi(nir, red):
    logger.info("Making OSAVI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("OSAVI",(nir - red) / (nir + red + 0.16))

# Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI)
"""
A vegetation index which mitigates atmospheric factors (e.g., aerosols).
Kuafman and TanrÃ© corrected NDVI to mitigate atomspheric scattering effects
by doubling the red band measurements and adding blue wavelengths
"""
def arvi(nir, red, blue):
    logger.info("Making ARVI matrix")

# Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)
"""
Liu and Huete introduced EVI to adjust NDVI results to atmospheric and 
soil noises, particually in dense vegetation areas.
The value range for EVI is -1 to 1, and for healthy vegetation, it
varies between 0.2 and 0.8
"""
def evi(nir, red, blue, c1, c2, l):
    logger.info("Making EVI matrix")

    write_index_to_file("EVI",(2.5 * ((nir - red) / ((nir) + (c1 * red) - (c2 * blue) + l))))

# Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI)
"""
Enhances vegetation under strong atmospheric impact while smooting illumination
variations. 
"""

# Leaf Area Vegetation Index (LAI)
"""
Designed to analyze the foliage surface of earth and estimate the quantity
of leaves in a specific region. 
"""

    # This index requires some form of computer vision to identify the land 
    # mass of an image, and than create a ratio of land mass covered by biomass
    # I have excluded it for now.

# Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)
"""
Used to highlight burned areas following a fire. 
Healthy vegetation shows a high reflectance in the NIR spectum, whereas 
the recently burned areas of vegetation reflect highly in the SWIR spectrum

    write_index_to_file("NBR",((nir - swir) / (nir + swir)))

# Structure Insensitive Pigment Vegetation Index (SIPI)
"""
Provides analysis of vegetation with variable sanopy structure. It estimates
the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll: an increasing valye signals vegetation stress
"""

    logger.info("Making SIPI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("SIPI",((nir - blue) / (nir - red)))

# Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCI)
"""
Used to estimate the content of leaf chlorophyll in various species of plant. 
The chlorophyll content reflects the physiological state of vegetation; it 
decreases in stressed plants and can therefore be used as a measurement of 
vegetation health

    logger.info("Making GCI matrix")
    write_index_to_file("GCI",(nir / green - 1))

# Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)

in the VIS band. Cloud reflection in these bands are high, allowing snow 
and clouds to be distingushed from each other.
